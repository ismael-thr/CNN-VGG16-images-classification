# Transfer Learning & VGG16 for classification task

In this work, we will try to classify into 3 categories the different flower's pictures we have in the "flowers" file. 
We will first use a CNN build from a first intuition, then do some transfer learning to use the well known VGG16 model and compare the results.
We will also do some data augmentation to see how it can modify the accuracy of the model.

PS: Google collab can be a better option to work on this example, it gives more computational power
